# Implementation Plan for Scope, Proc and Graph (2025-06-09)

This document outlines the planned steps for implementing the three partially
implemented core classes located in `src/tg/core`: `Scope`, `Proc` and
`Graph`.  These classes currently provide only skeletal interfaces.  The goal is
for them to correctly build and manage a directed execution graph composed of
`Step` objects and the data exchanged between steps.

The plan below follows the existing design notes in `docs/design` and keeps
within the current prototype’s scope (single‑threaded execution, no scheduler or
thread pool yet).

## 1. `Scope`

1. **Add constructors**
   - Provide a default constructor that assigns a unique scope name (e.g. using a
     static counter or UUID generator).
   - Allow an explicit name to be passed in for cases where the caller wants a
     deterministic prefix.
2. **Expose a setter for the scope name**
   - `void set_name(std::string)`; mainly for factory/test use.
3. **Keep `name()` implementation**
   - Return `m_name`.
4. **Implement `visit(Proc&)`**
   - Obtain all steps from the `Proc` and call `visit(Step&)` on each.
5. **Implement `visit(Step&)`**
   - Use `DataCallback` to traverse the step’s `StepData` objects.
   - Delegate to `visit(StepData&)` for each item.
6. **Implement `visit(StepData&)`**
   - Simply set the `scope_name` of the `StepData` to `m_name`.
   - Later phases may also register the data item with internal lists.

## 2. `Proc`

1. **Construction and destruction**
   - Default construct an internal `Scope` instance.
   - Optionally accept a scope name so that multiple procs can coexist with
     predictable prefixes.
2. **`add_step(StepPtr)`**
   - Validate the pointer is non‑null, otherwise throw.
   - Use a `DataCallback` to set the scope name on each `StepData` contained in
     the step via the associated `Scope`.
   - Store the step in `m_steps` for later graph assembly.
   - No scheduling or key assignment happens here yet.
3. **`get_steps()`**
   - Copy `m_steps` into the output vector.  The caller may inspect or iterate
     the collection.
4. **Future hook for data unification**
   - Keep a placeholder comment describing how matching `StepData` names inside
     the proc will later be consolidated during graph compilation.

## 3. `Graph`

1. **Internal storage**
   - Maintain:
     - `std::vector<StepPtr> m_steps;`
     - `std::vector<DataImplPtr> m_data;`
     - `std::unordered_map<AccessKey, KeyInfo> m_keys;`
     - `std::unordered_map<std::string, size_t> m_name_to_index;` mapping fully
       qualified data names to indices in `m_data`.
2. **`add_step(ScopePtr, StepPtr)`**
   - Verify inputs are non‑null.
   - Use `DataCallback` to visit each `StepData` in the step.
   - Form the fully qualified data name from the scope name and the
     `StepData`’s own name.
   - If the name is new:
     - Create a fresh `AccessKey` (monotonic counter).
     - Create a new `DataImpl` with the type from the `StepData` and push it to
       `m_data`.
     - Store `{access_key, usage}` in the `DataImpl`’s key/usage list.
     - Record the mapping in `m_name_to_index` and `m_keys`.
   - If the name already exists:
     - Locate the existing `DataImpl`.
     - Check the type matches; throw on mismatch.
     - Append a new key/usage pair to that `DataImpl`.
   - Assign the generated access key back to the `StepData` and freeze its
     metadata.
   - Append the step to `m_steps`.
3. **`finalize()`** (new helper method)
   - After all steps have been added, construct an `ExecData` instance from
     `m_data` and `m_keys`.
   - This object will later be fed to `StepExecutor` for each step.
4. **`execute_all()`** (simple sequential runner)
   - For now, run each stored step through `StepExecutor` sequentially using the
     shared `ExecData`.
   - Concurrency, scheduling and barrier logic remain future work.

## 4. Milestones

1. **Compile‑time only**: Implement the classes and ensure they build with the
   existing unit tests (`blur_step_testcase`, etc.).
2. **Simple integration test**: Build a small proc with two steps that share a
   data name and run it through `Graph::execute_all()` to verify data passing via
   `ExecData` works.
3. **Validation hooks** (later phase): integrate the DAG check and type
   validator described in the design notes.
4. **Thread pool and scheduler** (future work): once the single‑threaded graph is
   functional, extend `Graph` with a scheduler and thread pool as noted in
   `docs/design/historic_monologues/ai_planning_20250529_2244pm.md`.
