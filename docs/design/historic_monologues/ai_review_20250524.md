# Discussion: Impacts of Factory Design Decisions and Name Collision Handling

## Context

Files discussed: the first 2 iterations of factory mockup.

## 1. Analysis of Design Decisions from End-User Perspective

### Explicit Naming vs. Anonymous Objects

- **`factory_demo_cpp.md`**: Always assigns explicit string names to data and tasks.
- **`factory_demo_cpp_2.md`**: Allows creation of data/tasks without names, unless needed.

**Impact:**  
- Explicit naming aids debugging and cross-subgraph interfacing.
- Anonymous/unnamed objects remove boilerplate for internal or temporary objects.
- **User benefit:** Flexibilityâ€”brevity when possible, clarity when needed.

---

### Factory Method Overloads

- **`factory_demo_cpp_2.md`**: Provides overloaded `make_data` and `make_task` methods for different construction patterns.
- **`factory_demo_cpp.md`**: Uses a simpler API, setting properties after construction.

**Impact:**  
- Overloads reduce repetitive code and group object setup in a single line.
- Slightly steeper learning curve, but more ergonomic for power users.

---

### Functor Attachment at Creation

- **`factory_demo_cpp_2.md`**: Allows attaching a functor (callable) to a task directly at creation.
- **`factory_demo_cpp.md`**: Task logic/functor not shown at creation.

**Impact:**  
- Encourages concise, expressive task definitions.
- Improves encapsulation ("task" and "what it does" are bound together).

---

### Controlled Property Exposure

- **`factory_demo_cpp_2.md`**: Uses `Nameable` as a private base class, exposing names only as needed.

**Impact:**  
- Reduces accidental misuse or over-exposure of names.
- Encourages naming only when beneficial, leading to cleaner code.

---

### Factory-Managed Subgraph Export

- Both demos: Factory tracks created objects, making subgraph export easy.

**Impact:**  
- Users do not need to manually track components, reducing errors and development time.

## 2. Name Collision: Error-Proneness and Solutions

### Problem

While the C++ compiler prevents identifier collisions, it does not prevent two objects from being given the same **string name**.  
- This can be **intentional** (user wants the same logical object across subgraphs) or **accidental** (typo, copy-paste, unclear intention).
- There is no built-in mechanism to clarify user intent or catch accidental reuse.

### Suggested Solutions

#### 1. Factory-Enforced Uniqueness with Explicit Alias Registration

- The factory tracks all assigned names.
- On name collision:
  - Throws error/warning if unintentional.
  - Requires explicit "alias" or "reuse" method/API if intentional.

**Example:**
```cpp
auto d1 = factory->make_data("foo");
auto d2 = factory->make_data("foo");           // Error!
auto d2 = factory->alias_data("foo");          // OK: intentional alias
```

#### 2. Strict Mode or Linting

- Enable "strict" mode to enforce uniqueness unless explicitly overridden.
- Provide a linter/static analysis tool to scan for duplicate names.

#### 3. Load-Time or Compile-Time Validation

- After graph/subgraph construction, call `validate()` to check for name collisions.

**Example:**
```cpp
auto subgraph = factory->export_subgraph("mygraph");
subgraph->validate();      // Throws or warns on duplicate names
```

#### 4. Name Scoping / Namespacing

- Use hierarchical names (e.g., `"mod1/gray"`, `"mod2/gray"`).
- Collisions only checked within each scope.

#### 5. IDE/Interactive Feedback

- Integrate with IDE for autocomplete/warnings on duplicate names.

#### 6. Logging/Visualization

- When exporting or running a subgraph, create a report or visual graph to help spot duplicates.

### Solution Matrix

| Approach                       | Catches Accidents | Clarifies Intent | Usability |
|------------------------------- |------------------ |----------------- |-----------|
| Factory uniqueness + alias API | Yes               | Yes              | High      |
| Strict mode/linting            | Yes               | Yes              | Medium    |
| Runtime validation             | Yes               | Somewhat         | Medium    |
| Name scoping                   | Yes               | Yes              | Medium    |
| IDE feedback                   | Yes               | Yes              | High      |
| Logging/visualization          | No (preventative) | Somewhat         | Medium    |

### Recommendation

A combination of **factory-enforced uniqueness** (with alias/reuse API) plus **validation/linting** is robust:
- Catches most errors early.
- Makes intentional sharing explicit.
- Still supports advanced use cases.

Optionally, combine with visualization/logging for large projects.
